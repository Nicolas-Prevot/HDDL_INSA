Inpainting is a technique to reconstruct an image from a corrupted version of it. For example, if an image is corrupted by removing a part of it, we can try to reconstruct the image by filling the missing part in.

In the case where we can obtain a direct copy of the missing data, inpainting is a very simple task. However, in the case where we cannot obtain a direct copy of the missing data, inpainting is a much more complex task, since the missing data has to be constructed.
