    "Inpainting is a technique to reconstruct an image from a corrupted version of it. For example, if an image is corrupted by removing a part of it, we can try to reconstruct the image by filling the missing part in.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where we can obtain a direct copy of the missing data, inpainting is a very simple task. However, in the case where we cannot obtain a direct copy of the missing data, inpainting is a much more complex task, since the missing data has to be constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will use the [Generative Inpainting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07892) technique to reconstruct images from corrupted versions of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is to use a generative model to generate the missing data. The generative model is trained to generate the missing data from a corrupted version of the image.\n",
